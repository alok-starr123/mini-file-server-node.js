# Mini File Server with Node.js

this is my simple backend project built using **Node.js** to server static HTML, CSS and image files.
It's my first backend project, where I practiced core Node concepts like routing, file handling, and modules - without any framework like Express.

#Features
- Serve static HTML pages
- Serve CSS and images
- Basic routing using'if-else'
- File reading using 'fs'
- Modular structure (used 'readFile.js' as helper)

THIS IS MY BACKEND LEARNING JOURNEY | DAY-10.
MORE PROJECTS COMING SOON!
